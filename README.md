# Process Termination Loop
Repeatedly kills user-designated processes. Created to terminate annoying programs that were borderline impossible to disable.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Install Python 3.2 or above

Download end_process.py AND processes.txt

Edit processes.txt to include the list of processes you want to terminate (you can find these in task manager by right-clicking on a task and then clicking "details")

Edit processes.txt and set the delay to the number of seconds you want


If you are on Windows and are unable to terminate certain processes, you likely need to run the program as administrator.
Run Powershell or CMD as administrator, cd to the folder containing end_process.py, and then type "py end_process.py"
